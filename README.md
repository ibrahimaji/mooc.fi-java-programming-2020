# MOOC.fi Java Programming 2020 Answers

## About MOOC.fi Java Programming Course

MOOC.fi Java Programming is an Object Oriented (OOP) Java Programming course offered for free by the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en). It is aimed at anyone who wishes to learn programming, specifically using the Java programming language. Even if you are an experienced programmer, the course is worth taking if your Java skills are rusty and the course does a good job explaining how OOP works. The course is free and anyone can sign up for it, regardless where you are located or even if you are a student at the university.

During the Spring of 2020, the University of Helsinki launched their 2020 version of Java Programming, an updated iteration from their previously popular 2013 version.

## About this Github Repo

There are plenty of repos on Github that publish the 2013 version of the 2013 edition of the MOOC.fi Java Programming Course but because the 2020 version is so new, there are no Github repos from what I can find. To help future course takers, I have published my answers to Github so you can refer to in case you get stuck and unable to answer the assignment. **However, please try to it yourself before referring to the answers to get the best experience and education.**
